FCC-simulation
==============

This repository contains fundamental simulation program of FCC crystal under hypothesis of Lennard-Jones Potential and Longevin thermal condition in Molecular Dynamics.

Update log 20141203
Till this version, this simulation program serve as the mean of simulating:
1. Simulate the FCC crystal viberation in real world.
2. The interactive force is determined according to Lennard-Jones Potential
3. The adjustment of the force is given by Longevin thermal condition
